This project utilized a front-end built with React.js and Tailwind CSS, and a back-end powered by Node.js and Express. The Twitch API was utilized to retrieve live stream information, and to enhance the UI display in the live stream section, the Faze team was incorporated. To manage state and data, Redux Toolkit was employed, while Yup and Formik were used for form validation. Swiper was used to implement the slides.
